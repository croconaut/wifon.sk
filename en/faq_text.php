<p><b>What makes WiFON better than, say, Facebook Messenger?</b> The difference is mainly "under the hood" -- common messengers are completely useless when the device is offline, with <b>WiFON</b> you can communicate as if nothing has happened and even more:</p>
<br>
<li>You want to send a big file to a friend but don't want to be charged off your data plan or even one of you doesn't have a data plan -- <b>WiFON</b> will find the friend nearby and send him/her the file faster than any messenger will ever do!</li>
<li>You are somewhere without the signal but a friend of yours is online. Type a message on your device to anyone you like and it will be sent over the friend's device without him/her even realising it.</li>
<li>You are at a crowdy event like concert and mobile network is overloaded. <b>WiFON</b> loves crowds, the more the people, the faster the delivery!</li/>
</p><br/>
<p>
    <b>Are the messages really delivered even when the device is offline? How is that possible?</b> It's not dark magic, really. <b>WiFON</b> creates its own Wi-Fi network and use it to communicate with other devices. It's similar to the so called hotspot mode.

    <b>Is sending messages like that safe and private? Can't somebody read them?</b> It's true messages jump from device to device but that doesn't mean that they are readable on every one of them. Every message is encrypted and can be read only by the recipient.

    <b>That app of yours seems to be totally broken, nothing works!</b> Not surprising at all. :) We've spent years debugging and convincing Android devices to work as we wish, there are still scenarios when the app (or the p2p technology behind it) doesn't work as it should.
